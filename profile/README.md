This is the reading guide for the FakeAgent organization.

## Overview of the Organization:
In an increasingly digitized world, sex crime investigators face a growing challenge. Suspects are more frequently found on social media platforms where they attempt to manipulate their often very young victims. Virtual agents operate on these platforms using fake accounts to track down these suspects. The timely creation of convincing fake visual material represents a significant advancement in the investigative process. This software is not currently available, and it is the responsibility of the FakeAgent project team to find a soloution using AI.

## Project-Specific Repositories:
Each project repository has a specific focus. Refer to the README files in each repository for a detailed description of its purpose and functionalities.
